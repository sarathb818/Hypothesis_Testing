# Hypothesis_Testing
 Using the hypothesis testing we come to conclusion to a population based on the sample dataset.
# Steps of the Hypothesis Testing
1) Make Initial Assumption(Null Hypothesis-H0)
2) Collecting data
3) Gather evidence to reject or not reject null hypothesis( Accepting the Alternate Hypothesis-H1)

To find out the interpretations and conclusions from the data(statistics) we use the null hypothesis.

Tests such as the T test, Chi Square Test, Anova Tests are used.
